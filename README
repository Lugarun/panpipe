PanPipe is a simple Haskell script using PanDoc. It allows code blocks in PanDoc
-compatible documents, eg. Markdown, to be sent to external programs for
processing.

Any code blocks with a "pipe" attribute will have the contents of that attribute
executed as a shell command. The contents of the code block will be piped to the
command's stdin, and the stdout will be used as the new content of the code
block.

For example, we can execute shell scripts by piping them to a shell:

```{pipe="/bin/sh"}
echo "Hello world"
```

This will cause /bin/sh to be called, with 'echo "Hello world"' in its stdin.
It will execute this echo command, to produce 'Hello world' on its stdout. This
will become the new contents of the code block, so in the resulting document
this code block will be replaced by:

```
Hello world
```

Usage notes:

Code blocks are executed in the order they appear in the document, so later
blocks can rely on the effects of earlier scripts. For example:

```{pipe="sh"}
echo "123" > /tmp/blah
echo "hello"
```

```{pipe="sh"}
cat /tmp/blah
```

Will become:

```
hello
```

```
123
```

PanPipe will create a temporary directory, which all "pipe" commands will be
executed inside. This makes it easier to share data via the filesystem:

```{pipe="sh"}
echo "hello world" > file1
echo "done"
```

```{pipe="sh"}
cat file1
```

Will become:

```
done
```

```
hello world
```

If you want to include a script in your document *and* execute it, you can use
the "tee" command to save it, then execute it in a following block:

```python {pipe="tee script1.py"}
print "Foo bar baz"
```

```{pipe="sh"}
python script1.py
```

Will become:

```python
print "Foo bar baz"
```

```
Foo bar baz
```

To show a script's results *before* its definition, you can use three code
blocks:

<!--
Original definition, commented-out

```{pipe="tee script2.py"}
print "Hello world"
```
-->

Results:

```{pipe="sh"}
python script2.py
```

Definition:

```python {pipe="sh"}
cat script2.py
```

The "pipe" attribute will be stripped from the resulting code block, but
everything else will be left intact. Notice that options like syntax
highlighting should be chosen for the *output* contents, not the input.

For example, the following code block contains PHP code, but it's using "html"
as the language since that's what its *output* will be:

```html {pipe="php"}
<?php

echo "<ul>\n";
foreach (range(0, 99) as $x) {
  echo "<li>{$x}</li>\n";
}
echo "</ul>";
```

PanPipe also works on inline code snippets; for example, my root filesystem is
currently at `df -h | grep "/$" | grep -o "[0-9]*%"`{pipe="sh"} capacity.
